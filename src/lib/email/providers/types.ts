/**
 * Outbound mail provider abstraction.
 *
 * Lumimail's outbound path was hard-wired to the Cloudflare `send_email`
 * binding (`env.EMAIL`). That binding can only deliver to destination
 * addresses verified in the account, which is unsuitable for general
 * transactional mail. This abstraction lets an operator select a provider via
 * `MAIL_PROVIDER` while keeping Cloudflare as the default (non-breaking).
 *
 * Providers are intentionally thin: they translate a normalized
 * `OutboundMessage` into a single send call and return a normalized
 * `OutboundSendResult`. All persistence, validation, and webhook dispatch stay
 * in `src/lib/email/send.ts`.
